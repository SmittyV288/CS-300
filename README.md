# CS-300

- What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    - The problem I was trying to solve in the projects for this course was how to create a program for ABCU that met their requirements and what data structure was best suited for it.

- How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    - I approached the problem by working out with pseudocode how each program would function with each data structure. Data structures are important to understand because each is better suited for specific tasks. If you understand what each data structure is better suited for, it makes it easier to pick one that will work the best for a project.

- How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    - I overcame roadblocks in this course by using code review and referring to documentation to complete the requirements.
  
- How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    - I didn’t know about Big O prior to this course so moving forward, I’m going to consider time complexities when I’m designing software and developing programs. 
    
- How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    - My work on this project has helped me refine my naming conventions for variables and functions. I also have become a bit more detailed with my comments and I think I’ve done a better job at making it so that my functions can be used across different programs.
